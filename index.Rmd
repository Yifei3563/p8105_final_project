### Website Overview

There are two datasets in our project analysis. One is from the [Coffee Quality Institute](https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/) to rate coffee based on their acidity, sweetness, aroma, altitude, and region, offering an objective ratings about coffee. The other one is from the ["Great American Coffee Taste Test"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0), which examines consumer preferences. 

In the Exploratory Analysis tab, you will find:

 * The trends and distributions of [objective coffee ratings](data_exploration_ratings.html) by year, species, varieties, processing methods, altitude, and country of origins
 
 * The [consumer lifestyles and preferences](data_exploration_survey.html), displaying peopleâ€™s coffee-related lifestyle, their own assessment of their coffee expertise, and their tasting experiences with specific coffees
 
In the Statistical Analysis tab, you will find:

 * The statistical analysis for the [objective coffee ratings](analysis_ratings.html) about what factors truly affecting the coffee scores and whether coffee processing methods make a big difference in ratings
 
 * The statistical analysis for the [consumer lifestyles and preferences](analysis_survey.html), showing interesting demographic facts about coffee consumers and their preferences between two different coffees
 
 * A summary of [our analysis results](general_analysis.html)
 

The [Shiny tab](shiny.html) will explore your preferred coffee processing methods based on your lifestyle.

The [Report tab](report.html) provides a comprehensive overview of our analytical procedure, outlining each step in detail, and also a discussion about our findings combining the two datasets together.
