<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, coffee has transcended
national boundaries and catered to the tastes of diverse groups of
people. As a group of coffee lovers, we are well-realized about how
important a good cup of coffee can be for a fulfilling day. Therefore,
we wish to analyze the quality of coffee from two aspects – the
objective geographical factors and subjective costumer preferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The project utilizes the data from the <a
href="https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/">Coffee Quality
Institute</a> (the original data can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database">James LeDoux’s
github</a>) to rate coffee based on their acidity, sweetness, aroma,
altitude, and region, offering a comprehensive look at coffee. By
incorporating data on the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0">“Great American
Coffee Taste Test”</a>, our project also explores how consumer tastes
align with professional ratings. This combination of objective and
public data can provide insights into how coffee qualities influence
consumer preferences, helping producers, coffee shops, and consumers
make their favorite choices.</p>
<p>To make it easier to analyze the data, we named the coffee quality
ratings dataset <code>ratings_df</code>. There are many variables in
this dataset, and after careful consideration in relation to our project
questions, we have selected the following variables for this
project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>total_cup_points</code>: Total rating/points (0 - 100
scale)</p></li>
<li><p><code>species</code>: Species of coffee bean (arabica or
robusta)</p></li>
<li><p><code>country_of_origin</code>: Where the bean came from</p></li>
<li><p><code>variety</code>: Variety of the beans</p></li>
<li><p><code>grading_date</code>: When the beans were graded</p></li>
<li><p><code>processing_method</code>: Method for processing</p></li>
<li><p><code>aroma</code>: Aroma grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>flavor</code>: Flavor grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>aftertaste</code>: Aftertaste grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>acidity</code>: Acidity grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>body</code>: Body grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>balance</code>: Balance grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>sweetness</code>: Sweetness grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>altitude_mean_meters</code>: Altitude mean meters</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>We hope to obtain a comprehensive view on both the objective factors
that influence the taste of the coffee (e.g. species, altitude) and how
features of different populations affect their subjective preferences
for coffee (e.g. gender, education level).</p>
<p>Some possible questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much people would pay for a cup of coffee based on their
quality?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the public taste of coffee accord with the “official” level
of certification?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the countries with high coffee ratings in
general?</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between altitude and coffee
characteristics.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<div id="ratings-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Ratings Data</h3>
<p>For the ratings data, we first filtered out the variables needed for
our project analysis then removed the unnecessary ones. We created a new
column named <code>grading_year</code> by extracting the year as a
four-digit number from the grading_date column using the
<code>str_extract</code> function. This isolates the year, because we
want to analyze the coffee ratings based on the year instead of focusing
on a specific month and date. Additionally, the <code>species</code>,
<code>variety</code>, and <code>processing_method</code> columns are
converted into factors using the <code>as.factor</code> function. This
step ensures that these variables are treated as categorical variables,
making them suitable for our later statistical analysis.</p>

<p>We examine trends over the 8-year time period to get insights into
how coffee quality has fluctuated. The plot shows a non-linear trend of
average cup points across eight years. The years 2010 and 2018 exhibited
the highest average scores, while 2012 and 2017 saw significant dips.
The variability in cup points across years indicates that coffee quality
is not static and can fluctuate significantly, warranting a deeper
investigation into contributing factors.</p>

<p>We removed outliers by using the interquartile range (IQR) method to
identify and filter extreme values. After removing outliers, the boxplot
shows a more compact and representative distribution for both Arabica
and Robusta species. The general trends remain the same, with Arabica
having a slightly higher median and a wider data range than Robusta.</p>

<p>Washed/Wet processing dominates (around 60%), followed by Natural/Dry
methods. Other processing methods such as Semi-washed, Pulped
Natural/Honey are less common. This highlights the dominance of
Washed/Wet processing methods. However, alternative methods like
Natural/Dry still hold a significant share, prompting further
investigation into how processing affects scores.</p>

<p>This comparison evaluates how different processing methods impact
total cup points. The Natural/Dry processing method tends to yield the
highest median and total cup points, suggesting its potential for
producing higher-quality coffee. The Pulped Natural/Honey and
Semi-washed/Semi-pulped methods have narrower distributions, indicating
less variability in cup points. The Washed/Wet method is also
consistent, with a median similar to Semi-washed but a slightly broader
spread.</p>

<p>We are curious about the top coffee origins and want to see if there
exists regional strengths or cultivation efforts. Therefore we make a
table showing that top-performing coffees come from a diverse set of
countries, with no single country dominating year after year. Ethiopia
appears twice, with exceptionally high scores in 2015.</p>
