<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, coffee has transcended
national boundaries and catered to the tastes of diverse groups of
people. As a group of coffee lovers, we are well-realized about how
important a good cup of coffee can be for a fulfilling day. Therefore,
we wish to analyze the quality of coffee from two aspects – the
objective geographical factors and subjective costumer preferences.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<div id="ratings-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Ratings Data</h3>
<p>The project utilizes the data from the <a
href="https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/">Coffee Quality
Institute</a> (the original data can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database">James LeDoux’s
github</a>) to rate coffee based on their acidity, sweetness, aroma,
altitude, and region, offering a comprehensive look at coffee. By
incorporating data on the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0">“Great American
Coffee Taste Test”</a>, our project also explores how consumer tastes
align with professional ratings. This combination of objective and
public data can provide insights into how coffee qualities influence
consumer preferences, helping producers, coffee shops, and consumers
make their favorite choices.</p>
<p>To make it easier to analyze the data, we named the coffee quality
ratings dataset <code>ratings_df</code>. There are many variables in
this dataset, and after careful consideration in relation to our project
questions, we have selected the following variables for this
project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>total_cup_points</code>: Total rating/points (0 - 100
scale)</p></li>
<li><p><code>species</code>: Species of coffee bean (arabica or
robusta)</p></li>
<li><p><code>country_of_origin</code>: Where the bean came from</p></li>
<li><p><code>variety</code>: Variety of the beans</p></li>
<li><p><code>grading_date</code>: When the beans were graded</p></li>
<li><p><code>processing_method</code>: Method for processing</p></li>
<li><p><code>aroma</code>: Aroma grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>flavor</code>: Flavor grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>aftertaste</code>: Aftertaste grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>acidity</code>: Acidity grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>body</code>: Body grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>balance</code>: Balance grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>sweetness</code>: Sweetness grade</p></li>
<li><p><code>altitude_mean_meters</code>: Altitude mean meters</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Survey Data</h3>
<p>In October 2023, “world champion barista” James Hoffmann and coffee
company Cometeer held the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0">“Great American
Coffee Taste Test”</a> across the United States, during which viewers
were asked to fill out a survey about their demographic information,
coffee-related preferences and lifestyle, as well as their tasting
experience of 4 cups of coffee ordered from Cometeer. The data is
available at <a
href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-05-14">GitHub</a>,

<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>We hope to obtain a comprehensive view on both the objective factors
that influence the taste of the coffee (e.g. species, altitude) and how
features of different populations affect their subjective preferences
for coffee (e.g. gender, education level).</p>
<p>Some possible questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much people would pay for a cup of coffee based on their
quality?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the public taste of coffee accord with the “official” level
of certification?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the countries with high coffee ratings in
general?</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between altitude and coffee
characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>What influence people’s choice on favorite coffee?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<div id="ratings-data-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Ratings Data</h3>
<p>For the ratings data, we first filtered out the variables needed for
our project analysis then removed the unnecessary ones. We created a new
column named <code>grading_year</code> by extracting the year as a
four-digit number from the grading_date column using the
<code>str_extract</code> function. This isolates the year, because we
want to analyze the coffee ratings based on the year instead of focusing
on a specific month and date. Additionally, the <code>species</code>,
<code>variety</code>, and <code>processing_method</code> columns are
converted into factors using the <code>as.factor</code> function. This
step ensures that these variables are treated as categorical variables,
making them suitable for our later statistical analysis.</p>
<p>For the surveys data, to make the analysis of the ratings for Coffee
A, B, C, and D easier, we first used pivot long to turn coffee names,
features, and respective scores into different variables. Then, we
pivoted the dataset wider to make the features individual variables with
the scores as their values. All categorical variables are mutated into
factor variables, and we selected only useful variables for the analysis
from the dataset.</p>

<p>Firstly, we accumulate the frequency of the total cup points. The
distribution of total cup points is bell-shaped and similar to the
normal distribution. The most frequent total cup points is 83, and most
coffee beans are in the 80 to 85 cup points range.</p>

<p>We examine trends over the 8-year time period to get insights into
how coffee quality has fluctuated. The plot shows a non-linear trend of
average cup points across eight years. The years 2010 and 2018 exhibited
the highest average scores, while 2012 and 2017 saw significant dips.
The variability in cup points across years indicates that coffee quality
is not static and can fluctuate significantly, warranting a deeper
investigation into contributing factors.</p>

<p>We removed outliers by using the interquartile range (IQR) method to
identify and filter extreme values. After removing outliers, the boxplot
shows a more compact and representative distribution for both Arabica
and Robusta species. The general trends remain the same, with Arabica
having a slightly higher median and a wider data range than Robusta.</p>

<p>We also produce the boxplot of total cup points by varieties. Through
this boxplot, we know that Sumatra Lintong and Sumatra tend to perform
better than the others on the total cup points, while Pache Comun and
Java perform the worst. It is worth mentioning that the IQR of the total
cup points of Java is the largest, which means the total cup points of
Java have high variability and are more spread out around the
median.</p>

<p>Washed/Wet processing dominates (around 60%), followed by Natural/Dry
methods. Other processing methods such as Semi-washed, Pulped
Natural/Honey are less common. This highlights the dominance of
Washed/Wet processing methods. However, alternative methods like
Natural/Dry still hold a significant share, prompting further
investigation into how processing affects scores.</p>

<p>This comparison evaluates how different processing methods impact
total cup points. The Natural/Dry processing method tends to yield the
highest median and total cup points, suggesting its potential for
producing higher-quality coffee. The Pulped Natural/Honey and
Semi-washed/Semi-pulped methods have narrower distributions, indicating
less variability in cup points. The Washed/Wet method is also
consistent, with a median similar to Semi-washed but a slightly broader
spread.</p>

<p>This plot shows the distribution between the mean altitude of the
coffee beans and the total cup points. Although there is no obvious
trend if we only look at the scatter on the plot, we can see that there
is a positive correlation between mean altitude and total cup points by
looking at the increasing trend lines. As the altitude goes up, the
total cup points of the coffee bean increases.</p>

<p>We are curious about the top coffee origins and want to see if there
exists regional strengths or cultivation efforts. Therefore we make a
table showing that top-performing coffees come from a diverse set of
countries, with no single country dominating year after year. Ethiopia
appears twice, with exceptionally high scores in 2015.</p>

<p>To start with, we built two bar charts to evaluate the distribution
of the variables “brew” and “why_drink”. The resulting graphs show that
the most commonly used brewing method in the survey is “pour over”, and
people drink coffee mostly for it “tastes good”.</p>

<p>To investigate questions that can select multiple answers, we built
this co-occurrence heatmap. Based on its results, we found that most
people in this survey chose to drink coffee at home, while a proportion
of people who choose to drink coffee at home also drink it in their
office and in the cafe.</p>

would pay for coffee, some people would pay a lot more than what they
are actually paying for a cup of coffee, suggesting potential space of
improvement for current coffee market.</p>

<p>This percentage bar chart tells us that, the distribution of overall
coffee pick is mostly even for people who do not consider themselves as
coffee experts, while for those who consider themselves to be experts,
coffee A and coffee D are the most popular, a very interesting trend
that we will investigate further.</p>

<p>The boxplots imply the first potential difference between coffee
A&amp;D and coffee B&amp;C: coffee A&amp;D are more acidic while less
bitter.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will continue to discover whether this difference is
statistically significant, and what characteristics may influence
people’s choice on coffee A or D, while they are similar in some
flavors. Also, since expertise is a self-rated measure here, we will
also examine what factors are correlated with how people rate themselves
to be coffee experts.</p>

<p>To check the effectiveness of the variables, if these variables
affect the total cup points, we perform the correlation test between
these variables before building the model. A larger coefficient
indicates a stronger correlation. There are high correlations between
almost all independent variables and the dependent variable. Although
the correlation between <code>sweetness</code> and
<code>total_cup_points</code> is the lowest, the correlation is not
weak, so we will use all these predictors to build the model. Since
there are so many predictors, we will choose to make a lasso model.</p>

<p>The intercept value is 5.08, which represents the baseline predicted
value of <code>total_cup_points</code> when all predictors are zero.</p>
<p>All predictors (<code>aroma</code>, <code>flavor</code>,
<code>aftertaste</code>, <code>acidity</code>, <code>body</code>,
<code>balance</code>, <code>sweetness</code>) have non-zero
coefficients, indicating they contribute to the model at the optimal
lambda.</p>
<p><code>flavor</code> has the largest coefficient with the value of
1.97, suggesting that flavor is the most influential predictor in
determining the total cup points.</p>
<p><code>body</code>(0.579) and <code>acidity</code>(0.895) have
relatively the smallest coefficients, indicating that they have a weaker
influence on the total cup points compared to others variables.</p>
<p>The deviance ratio is 0.923, suggesting that the model explains a
significant portion of the variability in
<code>total_cup_points.</code></p>

<p>The results of the one-way ANOVA test, as displayed in the output,
assess whether there is a significant difference in total cup points
among different processing methods in the dataset. The F-statistic value
is 1.978 with a p-value of 0.0956. Since the p-value is greater than the
typical significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis. This suggests that there is no statistically significant

<p>The results of the pairwise t-tests, adjusted using the Bonferroni
method for multiple comparisons, reveal no statistically significant
differences in total cup points between any pairs of processing methods.
All adjusted p-values are greater than 0.05. This suggests that the mean
total cup points are comparable across the different processing methods
analyzed (e.g., Natural/Dry, Other, Pulped Natural/Honey,
Semi-Washed/Semi-Pulped, and Washed/Wet). The lack of significant
differences aligns with the earlier ANOVA results, indicating that the
processing method does not have a substantial impact on total cup points
when considering the current dataset.</p>

statistically support the distributions of the boxplots. That is, coffee
A&amp;D are significantly more acidic than coffee B&amp;C, and coffee

the tests on people’s overall preference tell that people also score

<p>While people who rated themselves as coffee experts like both coffee
A and coffee D, what may differentiate them from choosing between these
2 coffees? From this logistic regression model, we found that people who
like fruity coffee and were younger when taken the survey were more
likely to choose coffee D over coffee A. This corresponds with the
survey design that coffee D is a more innovative and fruity-mixed
coffee.</p>

<p>The multiple linear regression model filters style_bright,
style_fruity, style_juicy, strong to somewhat strong strength, light and
Nordic roast level, half-caffeine and full-caffeine, and gender_male as
significant predictors of whether people consider themselves to be
coffee experts. There are interesting overlaps with the previous
logistic regression model, as people who like fruity and juicy styled
coffee are also more likely to choose coffee D.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The trend in average total cup points across eight years reveals
significant fluctuations in coffee quality, with notable peaks in 2010
and 2018 reflecting higher overall quality and dips in years such as
2012 and 2017. Most total cup points fall within the 80 to 85 range, and
the majority of the sample coffee beans are Arabica, which consistently
achieves a higher median and narrower interquartile range compared to
Robusta. This aligns with Arabica’s reputation as a higher-quality
species, whereas Robusta exhibits greater variability, possibly due to
diverse cultivation practices and market applications. Additionally,
there is a positive correlation between mean altitude and total cup
points, with higher altitudes corresponding to higher-quality coffee
beans, further highlighting the impact of environmental factors on
quality. Processing methods emphasize the dominance of Washed/Wet
processing, which accounts for 60% of the dataset, reflecting its
widespread industry adoption, while Natural/Dry processing stands out
with the highest median cup points, suggesting its potential for
producing high-quality coffee and indicating regional or market-specific
preferences. Lastly, coffee origins underscore the global nature of
high-quality production, with Ethiopia’s prominence illustrating the
influence of regional factors and its established reputation in the
specialty coffee market, emphasizing the importance of local growing
conditions, geographic diversity, and altitude.</p>
<p>Our predictive modeling using regression analysis highlights flavor
as the most influential factor driving total cup points, followed by
aftertaste and balance, emphasizing the importance of these sensory
attributes in defining coffee quality and consumer preferences. While
body and acidity have relatively smaller coefficients, they remain
integral components of coffee evaluation. After conducting statistical
testing through ANOVA and t-tests, there is no statistically significant
differences in total cup points across processing methods, indicating
that the method of processing alone does not substantially affect coffee
quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Since Arabica coffee account for a large proportion of species in
our dataset, we cannot tell the objective difference in coffee
performance between the two coffee species. The data for a species with
a uniform distribution will provide more information for the relevant
analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratings data spans eight years, but it does not account for
external variables like climate changes, global market dynamics, or
agricultural practices that could influence coffee quality. These
factors could have contributed to the observed fluctuations but were not
explicitly analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>The survey is only toward American citizens, so we do not know
about people’s opinions on coffee from different countries. As culture
differs, people’s preferences on coffee may also differ. This is one
very interesting point that we cannot cover in our project but worth
further discovering.</p></li>
<li><p>The survey only asks two flavors for each coffee – acidity and
bitterness, but the professional rating scale has more factors like
balance and aftertaste. Can people who are not coffee professionals also
taste such differences and be influenced on how they choose their
favorite coffee? Future surveys can include more options on the flavor
of different coffees.</p></li>
