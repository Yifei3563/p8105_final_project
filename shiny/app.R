      Natural coffee may taste a little strange because it's highly fermented. It really comes down to

        The body of a brewed washed coffee is lighter. There is typically more brightness as well, because 
        of a cleaner acidity that balances out the sweetness of the coffee. <br><br>
        Based on your coffee drinking habits, we predict that you will prefer washed coffee to natural
