## The tentative project title

Not your average joe: what makes the best coffee?


## The motivation for this project

Since the beginning of the 20th century, coffee has transcended national boundaries and catered to the tastes of diverse groups of people. As a group of coffee lovers, we are well-realized about how important a good cup of coffee can be for a fulfilling day. Therefore, we wish to analyze the quality of coffee from two aspects -- the objective geographical factors and subjective costumer preferences.
