## Motivation
Since the beginning of the 20th century, coffee has transcended national boundaries and catered to the tastes of diverse groups of people. As a group of coffee lovers, we are well-realized about how important a good cup of coffee can be for a fulfilling day. Therefore, we wish to analyze the quality of coffee from two aspects -- the objective geographical factors and subjective costumer preferences.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the data from the [Coffee Quality Institute](https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/) (the original data can be found on [James LeDoux's github](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database)) to rate coffee based on their acidity, sweetness, aroma, altitude, and region, offering a comprehensive look at coffee. By incorporating data on the ["Great American Coffee Taste Test"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0), our project also explores how consumer tastes align with professional ratings. This combination of objective and public data can provide insights into how coffee qualities influence consumer preferences, helping producers, coffee shops, and consumers make their favorite choices.

## Initial Questions

We hope to obtain a comprehensive view on both the objective factors that influence the taste of the coffee (e.g. species, altitude) and how features of different populations affect their subjective preferences for coffee (e.g. gender, education level). 
Some possible questions include:
- How much people would pay for a cup of coffee based on their quality?
- Does the public taste of coffee accord with the "official" level of certification?
- What is the difference between coffees from different regions within the same countryï¼Ÿ
- What are the countries with high coffee ratings in general?
_ The relationship between altitude and coffee characteristics.
