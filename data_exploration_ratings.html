<p>Through this boxplot, we can know that varieties Sumatra Lintong and
Sumatra tend to performed better than the others on the total cup
points, when Pache Comun and Java performed the worst. It is worth
mentioning that, the IQR of the total cup points of Java is the largest,
which means the cup points of Java have high variability and are more
spread out around the median.</p>

<p>We removed outliers by using the interquartile range (IQR) method to
identify and filter extreme values. After removing outliers, the boxplot
shows a more compact and representative distribution for both Arabica
and Robusta species. The general trends remain the same, with Arabica
having a slightly higher median and a wider data range than Robusta.</p>

<p>In our dataset, Washed/Wet processing method dominates the
distribution, accounting for about 60%. Natural/Dry processing also has
a notable share, while other methods, including Semi-washed, Other, and
Pulped Natural/Honey, are much less commonly used.</p>

<p>The Natural/Dry processing method tends to yield the highest median
and total cup points, suggesting its potential for producing
higher-quality coffee. The Pulped Natural/Honey and
Semi-washed/Semi-pulped methods have narrower distributions, indicating
less variability in cup points. The Washed/Wet method is also
consistent, with a median similar to Semi-washed but a slightly broader
spread. Therefore, the differences in quality (as measured by total cup
points) is associated with various processing methods, with Natural/Dry
generally performing better scores.</p>

<p>This plot shows the distribution between the mean altitude of the
coffee beans and the total cup points. Although there is no obvious
trend if we only look at the scatter on the plot, we can see that there
is a positive correlation between altitude and cup points by looking at
the increasing trend lines. As the altitude goes up, the total cup
points of the coffee bean increases.</p>

<p>The diversity of countries shows that competition in the coffee
industry is global, with no single country dominating year after
year.</p>
<p>Brazil has been on the list twice (2011 and 2013), indicating that it
has consistently produced highly rated coffee during this period.</p>
<p>Ethiopia showed pretty good coffee strength with a top score of 90.58
in 2015, which is the highest coffee rating in those eight years.</p>
